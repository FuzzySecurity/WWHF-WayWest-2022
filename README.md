# Statikk Shiv: Leveraging Electron Applications For Post-Exploitation

Electron applications are ubiquitous, we use them every day. When you are listening to Spotify, talking to your friends on Discord or programming in VSCode; Electron is powering that user experience. Electron also drives common chat platforms like Slack & Microsoft Teams (v1.x). In this presentation we will review the attack surface of Electron application in a Red Team scenario; how an attacker can assume the userâ€™s identity and introduce novel tooling to instrument Slack for enumeration and internal social engineering purposes.
